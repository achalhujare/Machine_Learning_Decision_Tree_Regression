ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Regression with Scikit-learn

This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on guide to implementing Decision Tree Regression for solving regression problems. Using Scikit-learn, it shows how to build models that predict continuous values from structured input data.

ðŸ“Œ Covered Topics:

Importing essential libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Reading and exploring the dataset
Selecting features and applying necessary preprocessing
Splitting data into training and test sets
Initializing and fitting a DecisionTreeRegressor
Making predictions on unseen/test data
Evaluating model performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²) Score
Optional: Visualizing prediction results for better interpretation

ðŸ›  What You Need:

Python 3.x environment
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, jupyter notebook

ðŸŽ¯ Who Should Use This:

Anyone beginning with regression models in machine learning
Learners interested in understanding how Decision Trees work for continuous targets
Projects involving performance comparison with other regression techniques
